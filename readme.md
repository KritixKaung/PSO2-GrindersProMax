#Script Timing
This script is created for 144fps+ and around 100ping to server, if your performance has a huge difference from this the script might not perform as intended for you. If so try increasing sleep timers in 50ms increments.

#How To use:

##Buying Process
Walk to excube npc, position yourself where interaction is targeted, start buying process
Imporant Note: you must set your inventory to material tab and have no items prior to starting this script. 
The auto buying and selling works best if you have 0 grinders in your material storage. If you have some grinders in your storage it is best to clean them up first using manual selling function.
You can set how much meseta you want firstly and the script will only buy enough grinders to reach your targeted meseta. (1 means 1 million meseta target, max is 25 milliions target because that's around the maximum amount of grinders your mat stroage can handle. 0 means no target and the script will buy the max amount of grinders)
You can also see the amount of grinders you have bought and meseta amount of it in the GUI so if you're only buying for a small amount of money you can end the buying process sooner by clicking Stop Buying button

##Selling Process
Go to any NPC where you can sell items > Sell Items from Storage > Material Storage> Input Grinder in search and have grinders as your selection and start selling process
